## Introduction: 
At the beginning of summer I was committed to to start my reading ~~again~~, of the *Brothers Karamazov*. I was excited and decided to dive into the mysteries and enigmas of this <sub>extraordinarily</sub>special book. Being a **Philosophhical Novel** this story explores the **human condition:** *desire*, *love*, *faith*, *hate*, *fear* without any hesitancy. At first I was completley blind to its sublime richness and *depth*, this was the first time a "tried" to read it. This time was different. Every page is an adventure, and I have enjoyed all of it.
**Paradoxical as it sounds I have not finished it...** Fully aware that this does not really interest anyone but me **and/but** due to a lack of inspiration ~~and probably some guilt.~~ I intend to explore this situation that I find myself in.

## The *universal* issue of time
## Section 1: Other readings 
I have a terrible habit <sub>and I do mean terrible</sub>of buying books non-stop. And the *reasons* behind such impulse are extraorinarily *random*. I might enjoy the *title* or the image in the *front page*, maybe the *name* of the author sounds familiar or the *genre* interests me. It does not matter, *everypart* of a book is an invitation.
Currently due to **Dostoevsky's** influence I find myself *fascinated* by the context in which **Russian literature** developed through *time.* So, ~~why not?~~ I am also reading *A Cultural History of Russian Literature.*

## Section 2: Other activities
Sketching, watching movies, working out, writing, furthering  GIS skills. All of these things which I enjoy require more time than that which I have in a given day. More than an excuse I think of it as an *opportunity* to organize my time better. Not much to say here, if there are people that are attached to things they have, I could say that I am somewhat attached to *things I do.*

## Section 3: Work and School
As a student and a worker I spend most of my day either doing homework/in class or working, currently I work in two different jobs making time management extra tricky. Now, I am not arguing that reading *The Brothers Karamazov* is more important than my schoolwork ~~it kinda is~~.I am mearly being objective on the *reasons* why I haven't finished the book.
